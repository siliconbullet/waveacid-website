<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p style="text-align: left">
<ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: left">
<li><b>1. Which compounds is the synthesizer going to be most used for?</b></li>
<li>We assume it is cosmetics, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-cancer drugs, disease prevention agents, pain killers, birth control pills and psychoactives.</li>
<br>
<li><b>2. How does it work?</b></li>
<li>The WaveAcid Biochemical Synthesizer uses a base cartridge and advanced technology to compile pharmaceutical molecules from inorganic compounds and biochemical precursors.</li>
<br>
<li><b>3. What's a base cartridge?</b></li>
<li>A base cartridge contains amounts of basically every chemical element and a set of biochemical precursors such as Phenol, Benzene and (R)-4-Hydroxyphenylglycin. It also contains distilled Water, and several gases like Carbondioxide. The cartridge is meant to be exchangeable when empty.</li>
<br>
<li><b>4. How long does a single cartridge last?</b></li>
<li>Depending on the quantities and amounts that you are printing, a single cartridge might last for 1-15 pills of a substance. Numbers vary immensly between different molecules.</li>
<br>
<li><b>19. How much is one?</b></li>
<li>At the moment, it is priced at $100+ per cartridge, which might seem like a lot, but depending on its usecase is worth it. For example, if you are living next to a pharmacy and want to print 1200mg over-the-counter cough decongestant, it's not going to be worth it for you. If you are camping in the Canadian forrest however, and you need a broadband antibiotic, you are going to be happy to have it.</li>
<br>

<li><b>5. What's Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy?</b></li>
<li>It's a technique that uses infrared radiation to excite the molecules of a compound and generates an infrared spectrum of the energy by a molecule as a function of the frequency or a wavelength of light. For example, O-H bonds are stronger than C-H bonds. The measurable result is that O-H bonds vibrate at higher frequencies than C-H bonds. IR Spectroscopy is a method of traditional analytical chemistry and data generated by it generally gets displayed after or during mathematical operations such as Fourier Transform. We use it in our device for intermediate step verification, amongside Nuclear Magnet Resonance.</li>
<br>
<li><b>6. How do you go from chemical elements to inorganic compounds to biochemical precursors?</b></li>
<li>Substantial amounts of heat are generated by lasers in small chambers. Sequentially executed rounds of chemical reactions lead by an NVIDIA GPU cluster produce inorganic compounds. Single-atom and subatomic manipulation methods were borrowed from recent advances in Quantum Computing.</li>
<br>
<li><b>7. Is this legal?</b></li>
<li>At the moment this is an advanced research &amp; development effort, not a finished ready-to-use techology or product. Different legislatures are having different ideas about autonomous medicine, similiar to the act of 3D printing guns from CAD files. We are, to the best of our and our attorneys knowledge preparing a safe and universally legal product launch and will update you as we proceed. Ethically, the purity and readiness for human consumption, and advice given by AI (instead of a human doctor or pharmcist) is what matters most. The posession of the printer is universally legal; as is the posession of a base chemical cartridge. The posession and consumption of anything that you could print with it, is a whole different story, and in our opinion, should be up to you. We understand that many countries and states don't see it that way.</li> 
<br>
<li><b>8. Are there academically proven (university graduate or doctorate) chemists on your team?</b></li>
<li>Yes, but this is more of a physics effort than a chemistry effort. Synthesis of even most complex biochemical pharmaceutical compounds, like birth control or antibiotics usually takes weeks but still works in a chemical and biochemical fashion. Since our product and our promise requires to break that down to matters of seconds or minutes, traditional approaches to the study of matter demand cutting-edge advances from other disciplines of science - such as, for example - quantum electronics, photonics, ultra-resolution microscopy, artificial intelligence and particle acceleration.</li>
<br>
<li><b>9. Are there academically proven (university graduate or doctorate) physicists and computer scientists on your team?</b></li>
<li>Yes, just like there are PhD level chemists involved. Some work with us in a cladestine manner, demanding similiar stages of discretion as Wikileaks demanded for the submission of war crime documentation.</li>
<br>
<li><b>10. Is this effort venture funded?</b></li>
<li>We are venture funded by strategic partners, and accept crowdfunding as a minor way to participate or support this future-bringing effort.</li>
<br>
<li><b>11. How much computational power do you have available for training your machine learning neural network?</b></li>
<li>15x liquid-cooled NVIDIA TITAN V graphics cards with about 4 double-precision teraflops each.</li>
<br>
<li><b>12. What's High-performance liquid chromatography? (HPLC)</b></li>
<li>It's a technique in analytical chemistry used to identify and seperate components of a mixture, including stereoisomerically chiral components. It uses a moving gas stream of Helium or Nitrogen to carry a sample.</li>
<br>
<li><b>13. What's Nuclear Magnet Resonance (NMR)?</b></li>
<li>It's a technique that uses a strong magnet field measured in 'Tesla', shielded from any outside disturbances, for whole molecule identification. It does so by harnessing quantum effects of charged atomic nuclei, referred to as spin.</li>
<br>
<li><b>14. What's a Flow-Chemical Microreactor?</b></li>
<li>It's a very small platine, similiar in size and design to a silicon processor (sometimes even using silicon), that instead of electronic circutis, implements chemical circuits, for example to accomplish Friedel-Craft acylation.</li>
<br>
<li><b>15. What's Electrolysis?</b></li>
<li>In chemistry and drug synthesis, it's a technique that uses a direct electric current to drive an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction.</li>
<br>
<li><b>16. What's an Intermediate Step or Intermediate Product?</b></li>
<li>Different pharmaceutical or chemical compounds require, depending on the base cartridge and precursors used, a varying number of intermediate synthesis steps. That is different chemical compounds that occur in the process, before the final product was finished.</li>
<br>
<li><b>17. How do you assure purity for human consumption?</b></li>
<li>We are using a Palm-Size NMR and are developing a very small implementation of Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-AES) to make sure there is not even traces of potentially toxic or harmful substances or materials in the intermediate steps or final synthesis product. While the device is still in the work, we are using state-of-the-art HPLC, NMR, IR Spectrometers and a Nanometer Resolution Microscope.</li>
<br>
<li><b>20. What's the projected run-time for a single pill print?</b></li>
<li>We are aiming for 30 seconds max.</li>
<br>
<li><b>21. Which output formats are supported?</b></li>
<li>We support pressed pills, capsules, liquids and inhalables.</li>
<br>
<li><b>22. How much is the full device?</b></li>
<li>We're planning to release it at a $1500 retail price point.</li>
<br>
<li><b>24. What if the side products of chemical reactions are harmful or toxic?</b></li>
<li>Garbage collection and decomposition is constantly in progress. Disposable outputs from the device are completely harmless, while intermediate steps inside the chambers of course are not. The isolated tank structure and outer vacuum-seperated metal shell of the device makes sure that no toxic compounds ever exit the device. Any toxic compounds that are not needed for further chemical reactions are going to be instantly fragmented into chemical elements.</li>
<br>
<li><b>25. Are you 'mixing' compounds?</b></li>
<li>The WaveAcid Biochemical Synthesizer is both dealing with mixing ratios, temperature, light and pressure; and is also manipulating molecules on a subatomic level.</li>
<br>
<li><b>26. Which processors are you using?</b></li>
<li>Different chips serve different computational tasks, such as neural network, sensoric calculatations, operating system and cooling. Floating point operations play a huge role in chemical reactions.</li>
<br>
<li><b>27. Is dosage something you can help with?</b></li>
<li>We are working on a biosensor similiar to Intel Ventures backed Glucose-monitoring devices that seeks the currently active dose of any pharmaceutical in your blood stream and interstital fluids to cryptographically communicate with the WaveAcid Synthesizer.</li>
